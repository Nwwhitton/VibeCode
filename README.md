# VibeCode

What did you build?<br>
- I built a game where you aim your slingshot at objects that fall from the sky, you can also get upgrades for your projectiles.<br>

What language(s) or tools did you use?<br>
- I used HTML, and JavaScript for the actual game, then I used HTML and CSS for the Index file.<br>

Which AI tools did you use, and how?<br>
- I used ChatGPT and Claude, and they helped put my thoughts together and form the game. <br>

What did you do versus what AI helped with?<br>
- I made the ideas, and made the launching logic, the AI made the visuals, and did the math for the projectiles.<br>

What’s one thing you’re proud of?<br>
- I am proud of how the project went in the short amount of time.<br>

What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?<br>
- I was about to finish, but an error popped up, but it doesn't occur too fast, and it is about chance. I believe it is something with the refresh timing.<br>
